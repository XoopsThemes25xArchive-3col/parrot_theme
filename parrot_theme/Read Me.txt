Thank you for chosing one of our XOOPS themes

In order for the transparency to work correctly in the header area you will need to do the folowing:

Open File "iepngfix.htc" with any text editor and locate the folowing line:

if (typeof blankImg == 'undefined') var blankImg = 'http://my_xoops_url/themes/theme1/blank.gif';


Now, modify the path to the blank.gif according to your site's url.

That is all

Enjoy the theme, I hope it will serve you good.
